## Description

**The goal of the project is to deploy on a server a simple self-made copy of the AirBnB website logic.** 

- I won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track (i,e:*TOC*).
- In this repo we are only interested in generating the following parts of the larger project mentioned above:

  1. Creating the Data model of the project.
  2. Managing objects via a Console.
  3. Store and persist objects in a 'JSON' file.

*The aim is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “an object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from the`$ console` code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI we will build later, we won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how objects are stored.*

- This *abstraction* will also allow us to change the type of storage easily without updating all of the codebase.

- The `$ console` will be a tool to validate this storage engine.

---

## Files and Dirs

- `models` directory will contain all classes used for the entire project. A class, called “model” in a OOP project is the representation of an object/instance.
- `tests` directory will contain all unit tests.
- `console.py` file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
- `models/base_model.py` file is the base class of all our models. It contains common elements:
    - *attributes*: ``id``, ``created_at`` and ``updated_at``
    - *methods*: ``save()`` and ``to_json()``
- `models/engine` directory will contain all storage classes (using the same prototype). For the moment will have only one: `file_storage.py`.

# Python Development Guide

## Creating a Python Package

To create a Python package, follow these steps:

1. **Project Structure:**
Organize your project with a specific directory structure. A typical structure might include a `src` directory for source code and a `tests` directory for tests.

2. **Create `setup.py`:**
Define the package details, dependencies, and other metadata in a `setup.py` file.

3. **Write Code:**
Develop your Python code and organize it into modules within the package.

4. **Init File:**
In each directory that should be treated as a package, create an `__init__.py` file (can be empty).

5. **Install and Test Locally:**
Install your package locally using `pip install .` and test it.

6. **Distribution:**
To distribute your package, you can use tools like `setuptools` and upload it to the Python Package Index (PyPI).

For more details, refer to the official [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/).

## Creating a Command Interpreter in Python

To create a command interpreter in Python using the `cmd` module:

1. **Import the Module:**
Import the `cmd` module, which provides the `Cmd` class for building command interpreters.

2. **Create a Subclass:**
Subclass the `Cmd` class and override its methods such as `do_command` for handling commands.

3. **Define Commands:**
Implement methods named `do_<command>` to define the behavior for each command.

4. **Run the Interpreter:**
Instantiate your class and call its `cmdloop()` method to start the command interpreter loop.

Example:

```python
import cmd

class MyCmdInterpreter(cmd.Cmd):
    def do_hello(self, arg):
          print("Hello, " + arg)

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      interpreter = MyCmdInterpreter()
      interpreter.cmdloop()
  ```

## Unit Testing in Python

### What is Unit Testing?

Unit testing is a software testing method where individual units or components of a program are tested in isolation to ensure they function as intended. In Python, the `unittest` module provides a framework for writing and running tests.

### How to Implement it in a Large Project

1. **Organize Test Files:**
Create a separate `tests` directory in your project and organize test files corresponding to the modules or packages being tested.

2. **Use Test Classes:**
Create test classes using the `unittest.TestCase` class. Define test methods within these classes.

3. **Assertions:**
Use assertions such as `assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, etc., to verify that the code behaves as expected.

4. **Test Discovery:**
Run tests using the `unittest` module's test discovery mechanism, e.g., `python -m unittest discover tests`.

5. **Test Coverage:**
Monitor test coverage with tools like `coverage.py` to ensure a comprehensive set of tests.

For more information, refer to the [unittest documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).

## Serialization and Deserialization of Classes

To serialize and deserialize a class in Python, use the `pickle` module:

```python
import pickle

# Serialize
obj = MyClass()
with open('serialized_object.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(obj, file)

# Deserialize
with open('serialized_object.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    loaded_obj = pickle.load(file)
  ```

Ensure that the class being serialized is defined in the code before deserialization, and exercise caution when loading data from untrusted sources.

---

## Reading and Writing JSON Files

To read and write JSON files in Python:

```python
import json

# Writing to a JSON file
data = {"key": "value"}
with open('data.json', 'w') as json_file:
      json.dump(data, json_file)

# Reading from a JSON file
with open('data.json', 'r') as json_file:
      loaded_data = json.load(json_file)

print(loaded_data)
```

Ensure that the data being written to JSON is serializable, and handle exceptions when loading JSON from external sources.

---

## Managing Datetime in Python

To manage datetime in Python, use the `datetime` module:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Current date and time
now = datetime.now()
print("Current date and time:", now)

# Formatting
formatted_date = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
print("Formatted date:", formatted_date)

# Adding time delta
new_date = now + timedelta(days=7)
print("Date after 7 days:", new_date)
```

Explore the `datetime` module for various functionalities like parsing, comparisons, and arithmetic operations.

---

## Understanding UUIDs

UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit identifier that is guaranteed to be unique across both space and time. In Python, you can generate UUIDs using the `uuid` module:

```python
import uuid

# Generate a UUID
new_uuid = uuid.uuid4()
print("Generated UUID:", new_uuid)
```

UUIDs are commonly used to uniquely identify objects, transactions, or entities.

---

## Using *args in Python

`*args` is used in function definitions to allow the passing of a variable number of positional arguments. It collects additional arguments into a tuple.

```python
def example_function(arg1, *args):
      print("First argument:", arg1)
      print("Additional arguments:", args)

example_function(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

In this example, `args` would be a tuple containing `(2, 3, 4)`.

---

## Using **kwargs in Python

`**kwargs` allows the passing of a variable number of keyword arguments in a function. It collects additional keyword arguments into a dictionary.

```python
def example_function(arg1, **kwargs):
      print("First argument:", arg1)
      print("Additional keyword arguments:", kwargs)

example_function(1, key1="value1", key2="value2")
```

In this example, `kwargs` would be a dictionary containing `{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}`.

---

## Handling Named

Arguments in Functions

When defining a function, you can use named arguments (also known as keyword arguments) to provide default values and improve readability:

```python
def example_function(arg1, arg2=default_value):
      print("arg1:", arg1)
      print("arg2:", arg2)

example_function(1)  # arg2 takes the default value
example_function(1, arg2="custom_value")
```

Named arguments allow you to call functions with a clear indication of what each argument represents.
